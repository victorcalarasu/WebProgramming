# WebProgramming

Lab 2

Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://twitter.com/twitter. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript library.

Lab 4

Write a javascript which will be used in an html document that contains a tabel with 3 columns and several lines. When the user clicks the table header the script will sort in ascending order the elements from the current column. If the user clicks again on the column header, the elements will be sorted in descending order.

Lab 5 

Solve the following task using only the jQuery library (production version, jquery.min.js, or developement version, jquery.js); YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which contains a button and if the user clicks that button, a dialog window (like the one from http://jqueryui.com/dialog/) will be displayed. That dialog window should display various information. The user should be able to resize the window and also he/she can close the window by clicking on the 'x' icon. The dialog window does not need to be movable in the browser window.

Lab 7 

Write a web application for managing a multimedia file collection. The application should maintain various information about a multimedia file in the database (i.e. title, format type, genre, path in the file system etc.). The application should implement: multimedia file browsing (use AJAX for retrieving titles from a specific category/genre), adding, removing, updating a multimedia file from the collection. The files themselves does not have to be stored in the database. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category/genre), should be displayed (do this in javascript).

Lab 8

Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application which allows two (human) players to play the game ships ("vapoare" in romanian): each player has 2 ships deployed in a rectangular grid and they each try to sink the oponent's ships by bombing it (guessing the position of the ship on the battle grid). The game can not start unless two playes are connected. If a third player comes in, it will be rejected from the game with an error message.


Lab 9

Solve the same problem you got for the PHP lab, but using the ASP .NET technology. In addition to the specification for the PHP lab, your application must implement user authentication and ask the user to authenticate himself/herself prior to actually using the web application (based on an username and password saved in the database).
